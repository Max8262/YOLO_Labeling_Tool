Greetings. 

My name is Max.

It's a pleasure to meet everyone who stumbled upon this repo.
This is a python file to label and train images semi-automatically.
To use this, please download this repo and put it in C:/ and leave the rest of it to the code.

If you haven't use Multi-Template-Matching before, go check it out. It's amazing.
Well , it's more. Put your desire_to_train photos in the Original_Images Folder.
And use Paint to crop the template and store it in the Template_Images Folder.
Or you can just run Run.bat and it'll give you the instructions(sort of .......)

I'm still a noob, and I can't find a way to actually configure the folder_path to a specfic one when downloaded.
This is still in progress. I hope to make my own Labeling tool someday using AI.
Please feel free to give me any suggestions and comments you have.
Thank you.
